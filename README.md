## Project Working Title  
Predicting Abundance of Key Algal Species in the Rocky Intertidal of Acadia National Park  

---

## Background  
The rocky intertidal, including the shores of Acadia National Park, is experiencing escalating stressors such as warming waters and the spread of invasive species. Two habitat-forming algae, rockweed (*Fucus vesiculosus*) and knotted wrack (*Ascophyllum nodosum*), are disproportionately important to ecosystem health because they provide habitat, shade, and food for other organisms. These habitats are also an important recreation and interpretation space for park visitors. Understanding what drives change in these critical algae is necessary for anticipating ecosystem shifts and informing future management.

## Research Question  
What biological factors (including abundance and size of other species) best predict year-to-year changes in the abundance of *Fucus vesiculosus* and *Ascophyllum nodosum* in Acadiaâ€™s rocky intertidal?  

---

## Hypothesis & Predictions  
I hypothesize that the abundance of *Fucus* and *Ascophyllum* is primarily driven by invertebrate grazing and interspecific interactions with other algae and invertebrates species
