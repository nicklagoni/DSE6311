"0","#Found that site_name and plot_name were contributing significantly, dropped site as it is Acadia/BOHA and I am not interested in BOHA right now. Dropped plot name as it is just A1/A2/A3/etc. There is no actual similarity between A2 plots between sites aside from the fact that they are in the asco target species. Dropped target species as well because obviously target species would predict the community breakdown of those plots--they were chosen explicitly because of that."
